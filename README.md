# Dataset Card for the ViSpeech dataset

## Dataset Summary

The ViSpeech Dataset is a collection of unscripted audio recordings designed for the classification of gender and Vietnamese dialects. The dataset comprises 10,686 mp3 files, totaling slightly over 14 hours of speech data from 449 speakers representing both genders across the three primary Vietnamese dialects: Northern, Central, and Southern. It is divided into three subsets: a training set with clean recordings and two test setsâ€”one with clean recordings and the other with ambient noise. Notably, the speakers in the training set are independent of those in the test sets. The dataset is designed to provide a diverse and comprehensive resource for audio classification research.
